# **AgniVault 🔥 — A Secure, Developer-First File Vault**

AgniVault is a personal security tool designed for developers who want a reliable and private vault for their project files, assets, and sensitive resources. It protects what matters to you while staying simple, fast, and easy to use.

AgniVault is not just another encryption utility — it is your **personal guard** that ensures your creative and technical work stays yours, even when it moves across machines, repos, or environments.

## 🌟 **Why I Started AgniVault**

Modern developers deal with far more than code:

- Project configs  
- Environment files  
- Research notes  
- API keys (not supposed to—but people do)  
- Prototype assets  
- Documentation drafts  
- Private logs  
- Local build artifacts  
- Sensitive project data  

Yet most of us still store these in plain text or unprotected folders because:

- Proper encryption tools feel too heavy  
- Existing solutions don't fit a developer workflow  
- Password managers aren’t built for actual files  
- Cloud storage is convenient but not private  
- Git repos leak sensitive files too easily  
- Managing keys manually is annoying  
- Security setups break easily

I kept facing this problem myself.  
Every time I worked on a project, I found myself storing sensitive stuff in random places — either insecure or inconvenient.

That's when I decided to build **AgniVault**.

## 🎯 **What AgniVault Aims to Solve**

AgniVault focuses on three goals:

### **1. A simple, personal vault for project files**
Just choose a file -> encrypt -> done.  
No configuration, no overhead, no “security expertise” required.

### **2. Security built around *your* development workflow**
A tool that feels natural to use inside:

- Local development  
- Scripts  
- Build pipelines  
- Custom tools  
- Version control  
- Your usual command-line workflow

Not something that slows you down.

### **3. Strong protection without complexity**
You shouldn’t need to understand cryptography or manage complicated setups.  
AgniVault does the heavy lifting behind the scenes — clean, consistent, and automatic.

## 🌱 **Where AgniVault Is Going (Vision)**

AgniVault is designed to evolve into a complete security layer for developers:

- 🔒 Local and portable file vault  
- 🗂️ Project-level secure storage  
- 🚀 CLI-first workflow  
- 📦 File integrity & tamper detection  
- 🔑 Smooth key management  
- 🧩 Optional integrations with your build tools  
- 🌐 Future cloud-sync-compatible vaults (without sacrificing privacy)

AgniVault will always put **privacy first**, **developer experience second**, and **complexity last**.

## 🚧 **Current Status (Pre-v0)**

AgniVault is currently in active development with rapid feature iterations.  
The core functionality works, but many features are being refined before the first official release.

A full technical breakdown — encryption engine, file pipeline, architecture, benchmarks, and security notes — will be added in the v0 release.

## ❤️ **For Developers, By a Developer**

AgniVault is something I built because *I* needed it.  
If you’re someone who:

- juggles multiple projects  
- wants a private way to protect sensitive files  
- wants a tool that blends in with coding life  
- hates unnecessary complexity  

then AgniVault is being built for you too.
